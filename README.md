To [codestation](https://github.com/codestation) for [mhtools](https://github.com/codestation/mhtools).
And CAPCOM, for making the games.

Thanks again to [*&](https://github.com/AsteriskAmpersand) for their help fixing normals, uvs and edges (and a lot of blender stuff).

Special thanks to [IncognitoMan](https://github.com/IncognitoMan) for giving some inspiration for this, without him asking about it, probably MHFU support wouldn't be a thing.
